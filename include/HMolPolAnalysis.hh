 *
 * \brief <b>Purpose:</b> This is header file for
 *   the HMolPolAnalysis Class, which prints out
 *   the ROOT files
 *
 *   This class includes the top-level ROOT tree variables. For example, if the
 *   ROOT tree contains a branch 'Primary' which is (for each event) an object
 *   of the class HMolPolEventPrimary, then this class must contain a pointer
 *   to HMolPolEventPrimary which is named fPrimary. That branch is then added
 *   to the ROOT tree in the function ConstructRootTree().
 *
 *   For the various detectors this class has a vector of pointers to
 *   HMolPolEventGenericDetector objects. Each pointer corresponds to one
 *   branch in the ROOT tree. If you have a branch 'Detector1' and a second
 *   branch 'Detector2' then you will have a vector with 2 pointers to
 *   HMolPolEventGenericDetector objects.
