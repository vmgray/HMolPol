 * Programmer: Valerie Gray
 * Function: BeginOfRun
 *
 * Purpose:  Set up what should be done at the

 *      - Set up the output ROOT file nameA merge can result in conflicts which require user action. This is the case when the content of files cannot be merged automatically. These conflicts are marked with a label decoration in the Staging View. Using the Staging View to find the files with conflicts in order to resolve them is handy since the Staging View shows only modified files so that you don't have to wade through all of your resources but only those which might need your attention for resolving the conflicts.
 *      - Create ROOT file with that name
 *
 * \define run is a set of events for which a
 *      whole root file is produced.
 *      i.e. if one has /run/beamOn/ 1000 then
 *      a run is 1000 fired electrons
